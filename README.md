# automated_stock_prediction
The goal of my final project work was to create a machine learning model, based on data from 130 stocks over the last 14 years, which is able to recognize patterns in price movements and make predictions.

## Problem
One of the problems with stock analysis is the large number of companies to analyze. The New York Stock Exchange alone lists about 3000 companies. Even if you have put together an investment strategy, be it based on fundamental data, sentiment or technical analysis, you still end up with the problem of having to run your analysis across all the tradable stocks.
## Solution
So I developed an algorithm that is able to analyze the technical data of any number of stocks, recognize predefined patterns and, with the help of a machine learning model, make a prediction about the price trend.
